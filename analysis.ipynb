        "# Type Ia Supernova Hubble Diagram\n",
        "\n",
        "## Scientific Background\n",
        "Since the early 20th century, astronomers have known the universe was expanding by observing the redshift of stellar objects. It wasn't until 1998 that two teams of astronomers were able to deduce that not only was the universe expanding, but this rate of expansion was changing. This discovery wasn't a new idea to the scientific world, but theorists were shocked at the results of these studies.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Proposed Cosmological Models\n",
        "Since we knew the universe was expanding, there were three options for the universe's behavior:\n",
        "1. __It was slowing down__ due to the gravitational force from all the matter in the universe, eventually collapsing the universe back in on itself\n",
        "2. __It wasn't accelerating at all__ and the universe would continue to expand at a constant rate\n",
        "3. __It was speeding up,__ but this wouldn't make much sense with what we knew at the time. What could possibly be causing that?\n",
        "\n",
        "What we found in 1998 was that, shockingly enough, option 3 was correct and the universe's expansion was actually speeding up. The cause of this acceleration was dubbed \"dark energy\" and is still being heavily investigated today. The results of these studies would go on to win the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Methods of This Study\n",
        "The core idea of this study was that if you know how both bright a star is supposed to be and what wavelengths of light it should be giving off, then you can compare these expected values with your own measurements to find how far that light traveled and how fast the star was moving away from you. The problem here is that very few stellar objects are \"standard candles\" like this, which makes data sparse and hard to gather. Luckily, one particular kind of supernova — the type Ia (or one-a) supernova — has this exact quality, reaching nearly the same peak brightness regardless of the particular star, as long as it happens to a white dwarf under cerain circumstances. With this we have our two main data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Distance Modulus\n",
        "The distance modulus is a conveniant method of storing distance data in astronomy. It represents the difference between expected and measured magnitude of brightness. In the same way that a flashlight appears dimmer as it moves farther away, a type Ia supernova works the same way since we know how bright it actually is (about -19.3 mag). When gathering data on observed brightness, the distance modulus is the simplest way to convey the distance from type Ia SNe, but the distance the light traveled to get to us (called luminosity distance) is given by this formula.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\mu = 5 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{D_L}{10\\,\\text{pc}}\\right)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where $\\mu$ is the distance modulus and $D_L$ is the luminosity distance in parsecs. Rearranging this equation to solve for $D_L$ in megaparsecs (a more common distance metric) gives you this.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "D_L\\,\\text{[Mpc]} = 10^{(\\mu - 25)/5}.\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Going back and forth between modulus and luminosity distance is key for this kind of data analysis. It is also worth noting that luminosity distance is not the actual measure of how far away an object is (we can never know that) but how far the light we observe has traveled to get to us. It tells how far away on object once was.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Redshift\n",
        "The redshift seen from a star is caused by it moving either toward or away from an observer. Because of the doppler effect, the light it emits gets pushed to a shorter or longer wavelength depending on the direction of its relative motion. In our case with an expanding universe, stellar objects practically always have redshifted rather than blueshifted light. the redshift is expressed as a factor of the measured light frequency divided by the expected and this factor can easily be converted to a relative velocity between earth and what's being measured. However, what we're doing here does not actually need that velocity, so this conversion is not necessary for us. \n",
        "\n",
        "The redshift of type Ia SNe adn be found with a few different methods, including finding the redshift of the galaxy it is in or doing spectroscopic measurements of the supernova itself. The data set we pull from is a compilation of several different data sets on type Ia SNe gathered by the Supernova Cosmology Project, so the patricular methods might vary across this data set.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## What I'll be Doing\n",
        "Using publically available data on distance modulus and redshift for 580 type Ia SNe, I plan to find not only the current rate of expansion in the universe, but also the ratio of matter density to dark energy density in the universe that corresponds to the accleration of this expansion. This involves a lot of data analysis and more lines of code than I am willing to include in this notebook in good conscience, so all of my main helper functions have been stored in a separate python script that will be imported here as a module. This turns over 900 lines of code into about 250 while preserving the same function. I will still introduce these functions as I go and make sure to explain their structure, but to actually see the bulk of code behind this project, you'll need to look at the SNe_Hubble.py file in my GitHub repository.\n",

        "## Fitting For Hubble's Constant\n",
        "Hubble's Constant, written as $H_0$, represents the current rate of the universe's expansion. Conveniently, in the limit of cosmologically short distances from earth, the acceleration component of cosmic expansion has little effect, ad the relationship between luminosity distance and redshift will appear roughly linear regardless of what this acceleration is, and the coefficient connecting the two is hubble's constant. This makes it quite easy to filter for only the closest SNe and map a linear fit to the data to optimize for $H_0$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Low-z Mask\n",
        "To fit for hubble's constant, we first decide the threshold of values to include. I decided to only allow values with a redshift less than 0.03, but as long as the value is considerably below one it should be roughly fine. The program creates out low-z mask from the SNe data and stores the involved luminosity distances with errors along with their respective redshift values. \n",
        "\n",
        "### SNe.fit_hubble_constant\n",
        "We then use the fit_hubble_constant function from our imported module to find a linear fit for $H_0$. Essentially, this is a repackaged, specialized version of scipy.optimize.curve fit using the following formula:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "D_L=z/H_0\n",
        "$$\n",
        "Where z is the supernova's redshift. This lets us more efficiently run the function as many times as needed, which is crucial for the next step.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Sigma Clipping\n",
        "Just looking at the data and fitting for hubble's constant once would be sufficient, but our results could be slightly improved by removing outliers. We do this by iteratively filtering for outliers using a specifically designed function in our module. The function follows these steps:\n",
        "1. find residuals for SNe in our low-z mask using a given line of best fit\n",
        "2. find outliers within the mask (residual more than 3 standard deviations)\n",
        "3. flag these outliers, separating the initial low-mask into one of outliers and one of inliers\n",
        "\n",
        "We then loop this function along with fit_hubble_constant to iteratively search for and remove outliers, finding at most three outliers each time and stopping once we only find one, up to a maximum of five iterations. After each iteration, we re-fit for hubble's constant so that the final result is an outlier-free line of best fit."
